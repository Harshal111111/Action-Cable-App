# Readme

For this Task I have used action cbale to create a basic chat application.

Also I have implemented styling.

Added time formatting, like when the message was sent just to make the user experience a little cleaner.

To test the application:

1. clone the repo using the following command:

        https://github.com/Harshal111111/Action-Cable-App.git

2. Open terminal and navigate to cloned directory.

3. Install dependencies by running `bundle  install` in your terminal.

4. Start server by running `rails s`.

5. Open two different browsers and navigate to 'localhost:3000'.

6. Type in some message in the text field and click submit button.

7. You can see the message will be shown in both the browsers.
